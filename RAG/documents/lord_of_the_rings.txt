The Lord of the Rings is a book deeply rooted in the habits of 
its world, and through its pages, the reader becomes a quiet 
witness to them. From the very first chapter, Tolkien invites us 
into the peaceful routines of the Shire, where hobbits live 
simple lives filled with gardening, shared meals, pipe-smoking, 
and the joys of community. These small customs create a sense of 
comfort and warmth, allowing the reader to feel at home among the 
hills and fields of Middle-earth. Yet, as the story unfolds, both 
the characters and the reader are gently but firmly pulled away 
from these habits and into the wide, uncertain world beyond. As 
Frodo and his friends leave behind the familiar, so too does the 
reader, stepping into lands where danger, wonder, and sorrow 
wait. Slowly, the pages teach us that while habits offer comfort, 
true growth comes from stepping beyond them. The book becomes a 
journey not only for its characters but also for the reader, who 
by the end, finds themselves transformed by the beauty, hardship, 
and wisdom hidden within the story. The reader finishes not only 
having read an adventure but having lived through one.
